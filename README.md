# Performance

## The Project


The Performance project is a website for the Performance driving school. It is a showcase website but also has several functionalities. As an auto school is a local business, the site is entirely in French, and there is no need for translation.

    * Ability to add employees.
    * Implementation of agency schedules.
    * Creation of the pricing grid for different licenses.
    * All these functionalities are achievable through an administration panel.

## Features
##### Firewall 
    * Some roles are already configured: ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN ; ROLE_ADMIN.
    * A custom user checker is configured in src/Security/UserChecker.php preventing User to log in if not active.

##### Secrets
Secret command is heavily used to store passwords, even for .env file. Here is a default list with variables (use "php bin/console secrets:list" to show in terminal) :
* DATABASE_URL : to connect to your database.
* MAILER_DSN : to connect to your mail box.
* MAILER_FROM_ADDRESS : the destination email address. 

##### Documents (doc)
A "documents" directory is already created in root project. You can store any document relative to the projects/technologies used. By default you can find :
* UML : store UML schemas (txt & jpeg). https://app.diagrams.net is used to generate theses files.

##### Creation of the super-admin
The loaded data already includes several users; nevertheless, you must create your own user who will have all the rights. A command has been specially created for this purpose:
```
php bin/console app:create-super-admin
```

##### Authentication
    * Login page : /login
    * Forgotten password page
    * Login throttling : manage it in /config/packages/security.yaml

##### Image
"The images for the site (including banners) are present in the repository (/public/assets/images). However, the images that are uploadable are not there (public/uploads/images). Feel free to proceed according to your imagination!"
